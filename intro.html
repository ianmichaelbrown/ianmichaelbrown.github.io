								<p>
									So, I finally got around to doing what I knew I had to do if I was ever going to be a better developer - I've started learning properly about web development.
									I already know a bit about this, but have a fair bit more experience in the non-web world (what <em>used</em>&nbsp; to be called 'desktop' applications),
									so now it's time to get good at what are <em>now</em>&nbsp; called desktop applications and ultimately bring everything together to turn myself into a fully-fledged FULL STACK DEVELOPER!
								</p>
								<p>
									This journey is all about learning and there are many, many things to be learnt, but here is what I've discovered so far in order to get this site going:<br/>
									<ul>
										<li>
											HTML Templates:&nbsp; These provide a starting point for quickly creating a site with a certain style.&nbsp; There are many sources of such templates.&nbsp; This site uses one called 'Future Imperfect'
											from <a href="https://html5up.net">HTML5 UP!</a>, which has been adapted to fit with the style of this site.											
										</li>
										<li>
											GitHub Pages:&nbsp; One of many places where you can create a new website quickly and easily.&nbsp; Go to the <a href="https://pages.github.com/">main page</a> to learn how to create a site.
										</li>
										<li>
											Git:&nbsp; I've used Git for a while but not really from the command line, so I'm building my knowledge on this.&nbsp; I'm also learning about and using Windows Terminal and Powershell
											to work with Git commands.&nbsp; To help with this, I used some great info found in a <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/how-to-make-a-pretty-prompt-in-windows-terminal-with-powerline-nerd-fonts-cascadia-code-wsl-and-ohmyposh">blog post</a>
											by the wonderful <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/">Scott Hanselman</a>, showing a really nice way to decorate your terminal prompt to make things clearer when working with the Git command line.
										</li>
										<li>
											Font Awesome:&nbsp; The social icons at the bottom of this site's pages come from <a href="https://fontawesome.com">Font Awesome</a>, which has all the icons you could ever need!
										</li>
										<li>
											Images:&nbsp; When developing a site it's really useful to be able to add placeholder images, until you've found or created the real ones.&nbsp;
											<a href="https://unsplash.com">Unsplash.com</a> is a hugely-useful resource for this purpose.
										</li>
										<li>
											HTML & CSS:&nbsp; I've used these for a while but only on a fairly basic level, so my aim is to become really proficient in both, as this is essential for being a web developer.&nbsp; Examining and updating an HTML template,
											such as the one this site is based on, has already proved to be a great way to increase my knowledge in both these areas, but this will really improve during the process of creating my personal website.&nbsp;
											I've already watched or read <em>many</em>&nbsp; tutorials on these and a lot of other 'webby' topics, but the generally-accepted way to avoid <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Tutorial%20Hell">tutorial hell/purgatory</a>
											is to actually try things out rather than just watch hundreds of tutorials.&nbsp; One of many good examples of what to do is in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GB9qKbmGko">this video</a> by the ever-helpful
											<a href="https://www.facebook.com/GrindReel/">Joshua Fluke</a>,&nbsp; whose <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-91UA-Xy2Cvb98deRXuggA">YouTube channel</a> has a whole heap of useful and interesting content.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>
									Some other content that I've found useful up to this point:
									<!-- (also people's vids, blogs: kevin powell, josh fluke, etc.) -->
									<ul>
										<li><a href="https://quanticdev.com/articles/how-to-use-github/">How to use GitHub</a></li>
										<li><a href="https://dev.to/jorenrui/a-look-into-how-i-manage-my-personal-projects-my-git-github-workflow-1e7h#:~:text=In%20GitHub%2C%20you%20can%20create,how%20it%20is%20shown%20above.">Managing projects with GitHub</a></li>
										<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJZv4d5rbIKd4QHMPkcABCw">Kevin Powell on YouTube</a> - Kevin's videos have a wealth of excellent guidance - even if he can't say 'specificity' (sorry Kevin) <i class="far fa-smile-wink"></i></li>
									</ul>
