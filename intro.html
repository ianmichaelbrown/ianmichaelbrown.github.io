								<p>
									Things I've learned about so far in order to get this site going:<br/>
									<ul>
										<li>
											HTML Templates: this site is based on a template from <a href="https://html5up.net">HTML5 UP!</a>&nbsp;
											There are many other sources of such templates and they all provide a starting point for quickly creating a site with a certain style.&nbsp;
											This site is an adaptation of the 'Future Imperfect' template.
										</li>
										<li>
											GitHub Pages: One of many places where you can create a new website quickly and easily.  Go to the <a href="https://pages.github.com/">main page</a> to learn how to create a site.
										</li>
										<li>
											Git: I've used Git for a while but not really from the command line, so I'm building my knowledge on this.&nbsp; I'm also using Windows Terminal and Powershell&nbsp;
											to work with Git commands.  I came across a really nice way to decorate your terminal prompt to make things clearer when working with Git.&nbsp;
											All the info you should need can be found in a <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/how-to-make-a-pretty-prompt-in-windows-terminal-with-powerline-nerd-fonts-cascadia-code-wsl-and-ohmyposh">blog post</a>
											by the wonderful <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/">Scott Hanselman</a>.
										</li>
										<li>
											Font Awesome: The social icons at the bottom of this site's pages come from <a href="https://fontawesome.com">Font Awesome</a>, which has all the icons you could ever need!
										</li>
										<li>
											Images: When developing a site it's really useful to be able to add placeholder images, until you've found or created the real ones.&nbsp;
											<a href="https://unsplash.com">Unsplash.com</a> is a hugely-useful resource for this purpose.
										</li>
										<li>
											HTML & CSS: I've used these for a while but only on a fairly basic level, so my aim is to become really proficient in both, as this is essential for being a web developer.&nbsp; Examining and updating an HTML template,
											such as the one this site is based on, has proved to be a good way to increase my knowledge in both these areas, but this will really improve during the process of creating my personal website.&nbsp;
											I've already watched or read <em>many</em> tutorials on these and a lot of other 'webby' topics, but the generally-accepted way to avoid <a href="">tutorial hell/purgatory</a> is to actually try things out&nbsp;
											rather than just watch hundreds of tutorials on web development.  One of many good examples of what to do is in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GB9qKbmGko">this video</a> by the ever-helpful
											<a href="https://www.facebook.com/GrindReel/">Joshua Fluke</a>,&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-91UA-Xy2Cvb98deRXuggA">YouTube channel</a> has a whole heap of useful and interesting content.

									</ul>

									(also people's vids, blogs: kevin powell, josh fluke, etc.)
